# Awesome Open Source Organisation

A list of organisation (non-profit & for-profit) that open source everything they do and are still able to exist. This does not include "Open Core" product, since it is a proprietary licence.

Please help me grow this list :)

## The List

Each item should come with a link to the company page, a link to the repositories/organisation, and a small description
